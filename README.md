Hello, it's good to see you again. To simplify, this submod adds a little bit of everything, hence the name Extra+ or ExtraPlus, whichever you prefer to call it, so you can enjoy it with your Monika even though it has little content. I have several ideas in mind to implement here or in another submod. Currently, it is in beta phase, so several things may change before the stable release.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 **Play new Minigames:** Enjoy new games with Monika to pass the time.
- 🥰 **Boop Monika:** Unlock a cute new interaction to boop Monika on the nose.
- 📅 **Go on Dates:** Take Monika on special dates outside of the spaceroom.
- ➕ **Explore new Additions:** Discover secrets, new dialogue, and other small surprises.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites
* A working installation of Monika After Story (version 0.12.15 or higher is recommended).

## 🚀 Usage & Affection Requirements

To unlock the features of Extraplus, you will need to earn Monika's affection:

- **Dating:** Requires `400` affection points.
- **"Boop" interaction:** Requires `30` affection points.
- **Minigames:** Requires `30` affection points.

> 💡 **Tip:** To get your own Chibika, go to the `Additions` menu and select the `Hi [Your Name]!` option. This will make her appear, and you can then customize her with accessories and outfits.

## Installation
1. Unzip the submod zip file.
2. Copy the "game/" folder and paste it into your Monika After Story folder.

## Does the submod not work?
- **If the submod does not work (1.0.5 or higher):** If you see the message "The files are not available...," simply reinstall the submod as some files may not have been found.
- **If the submod does not work (1.0.5 or higher):** If you see the message "Because there is a 'game' folder in the submod," please refer to this video.

- **If the submod does not work (1.3.1 or higher):** The file checker has been removed because many people were getting those messages in previous versions. That is why I recommend checking that you followed the tutorial correctly, as this submod uses ACS files that go in the game-> mod_assets-> monika-> a folder. That is why it is not recommended to paste it in the submods folder.

- **If the submod does not work (before 1.0.5):** Watch this short video.

## Accessories for Chibika.
-Currently, the way to obtain accessories has been removed due to some problems where the folder was not recognized, or if another accessory was added, they would move and become annoying. I am considering how to fix this because I know some people made accessories for their Chibika.
-The chibika sprites can be taken directly from the submod, as they were added to the other chibis in the club, so there is no need to leave the sprite here.

>If this submod is edited by another person and sends that modification to the community, I am not responsible for the errors that it presents by what the other person coded. That's why I put in the submod a button to send it here so you can see what's new in this submod, thanks for your attention.
