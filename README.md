Hello, it's good to see you again. To simplify, this submod adds a little bit of everything, hence the name Extra+ or ExtraPlus, whichever you prefer to call it, so you can enjoy it with your Monika even though it has little content. I have several ideas in mind to implement here or in another submod. Currently, it is in beta phase, so several things may change before the stable release.

## ‚ú® Features
- üéÆ **Play new Minigames:** Enjoy new games with Monika to pass the time.
- ü•∞ **Boop Monika:** Unlock a cute new interaction to boop Monika on the nose.
- üìÖ **Go on Dates:** Take Monika on special dates outside of the spaceroom.
- ‚ûï **Explore new Additions:** Discover secrets, new dialogue, and other small surprises.

## üöÄ Usage & Affection Requirements

To unlock the features of Extraplus, you will need to earn Monika's affection:

- **Dating:** Requires `400` affection points.
- **"Boop" interaction:** Requires `30` affection points.
- **Minigames:** Requires `30` affection points.

> üí° **Tip:** To get your own Chibika, go to the `Additions` menu and select the `Hi [Your Name]!` option. This will make her appear, and you can then customize her with accessories and outfits.

## üíæ Installation

This guide will walk you through the installation process. Please follow the steps carefully.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:
* A stable and working installation of **Monika After Story**. It is highly recommended to be on the latest official version of MAS.
* You have downloaded the latest release of **Extraplus** from the [Releases](https://github.com/Zero-Fixer/MAS-Extraplus-EN/releases) page.

### üìì Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Download and Unzip the File**
    * Download the `.zip` file for the latest release from the link above.
    * Once downloaded, unzip the file using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR. You will see a `game/` folder inside.

2.  **Locate Your DDLC Directory**
    * Navigate to your main *Doki Doki Literature Club* directory. This is the root folder that contains `DDLC.exe`.

3.  **Copy and Paste the 'game' Folder**
    * Copy the `game/` folder from the unzipped submod files.
    * Paste this folder directly into your *Doki Doki Literature Club* root directory.

4.  **Merge and Replace Files**
    * Your operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.) will detect that there is already a `game/` folder. It will ask if you want to merge the contents and/or replace files.
    * **You must select "YES"** to merge the folders and overwrite any conflicting files. This will add the submod's files into your existing game directory without deleting your progress.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Post-Installation Check

To confirm the submod is working correctly, start *Monika After Story*. After Monika greets you and the main interface loads, you should see a new button labeled **"Extra+"** on the screen. If you see this button, the installation was successful! Enjoy!

## üêõ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: I'm getting the message "The files are not available...". What should I do?**
**A:** This error usually means that some files were not copied correctly. Please try reinstalling the submod, making sure to copy and replace all files as instructed.

**Q: I'm getting the message "Because there is a 'game' folder in the submod...". What does this mean?**
**A:** This is caused by an incorrect installation method. Please refer to the video below for the correct procedure.

**Q: I'm on version 1.3.1 or higher and something isn't working.**
**A:** The old file checker was removed in version 1.3.1. Please double-check that you have followed the installation instructions exactly, as this submod adds files to the `game/mod_assets/monika/a` folder, not just the `submods` folder.

## üé® Chibika Accessories - Feature Status

**Important Note:** The feature to add custom accessories to Chibika has been **temporarily disabled** in recent versions.

This is due to technical issues where the accessories folder was not being recognized correctly by the game. I am actively working on a solution to bring this feature back in a more stable way in the future.

For now, Chibika will use the base sprites and appearances included in the submod. Thank you for your patience!

>If this submod is edited by another person and sends that modification to the community, I am not responsible for the errors that it presents by what the other person coded. That's why I put in the submod a button to send it here so you can see what's new in this submod, thanks for your attention.
