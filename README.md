A submod that adds small additions to Monika After Story (MAS), something that should be clarified is that I have not yet been reviewed by the developers so it is possible that bugs may occur. But it will take me enough time to make everything functional, there is no release date yet.

## Features
- Minigames
- Boop Monika
- Dating
- Additions
- Extra+ button for player convenience
  
## Conditions
In this submod there are conditions depending on Monika's affection.
- It takes `400 of affection` to go on a date with Monika.
- To interact (Boop) with Monika it is necessary `30 of affection` with her.
- Similarly with the minigames you need `30 of affection` with Monika.
- `If you want Chibika to be present permanently`, it is necessary that at least once it has appeared on your screen, for that you just have to press the Extra+ button several times until it is displayed but don't do it quickly, it will automatically add a new option in Addition as Hey Player!

## Accessories for Chibika.
- To add accessories for Chibika, you need to place them in `DDLC/game/submods/ExtraPlus/submod_assets/sprites/accessories` folder. The 0 folder is for head accessories and the 1 folder is for general accessories or objects.
- You just place the PNG in its respective folder and that's it, and you can place it on your Chibika.
- The base has been uploaded to Drive and is compatible with the other variants: [Chibika base](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iV6VZNsMpvjngYCkQ_yJf6YZbh1ypLAP/view?usp=sharing)
